#### *For many years I have been working in banking field at different positions (from junior specialist to manager and a head of department) connected with product or process developing. And for several last years in fintech industry only. For now I'm working at the position of product owner of Bank BelVEB OJSC mobile banking app named "UP". Having quite long experience in fintech I'm very interested in different app development (especially for iOS) and highly motivated to move to IT. I'm not sure if I want to be a programmer for all my life. Very likely I would become RM or PM or even get back to PO in future but for now I really interested in programming process and want to try it as a real programmer. To say the truth I had these intensions for many years but wasn't sure if i would be interesting as an employee for IT-company being 34-years old (for now). But my latest experienced in fintech made me to change my mind.*
